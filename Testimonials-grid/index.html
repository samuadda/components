                    enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. the entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint, they were veru hands-on and i never
                    had to wait long for assistance. The aglie team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact,
                    It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
